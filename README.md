I am a seasoned Technical Project Manager, looking to expand my radar by dabbling in some Data Analytics, Visualization and coding. It has been a few years since I actively engaged in hands-on coding, so I am excited to get back on that realm. My current interests/goals to expand my knowledge and experience set are: Re-learning Python, R, Analytics and Visualization with Tableau and contribute to Project Management tools in GitHub. If you see me around, I'm looking for ways to learn and collaborate so please feel free to say Hi!
